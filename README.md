unity3d_sprite_system
=====================

!! 

THIS CODE IS DEPRECATED

The Unity Team added official support for 2D sprites in the latest version of Unity3D. You should use that now, as it's much more optimized than this code could possibly be.

!!

System that allows for generation and animation of sprite sheet from a source directory of images.
