unity3d_sprite_system
=====================

** THIS CODE IS DEPRECATED! USE THE UNITY3D OFFICIAL TOOLS! **

I originally wrote this "plug-in" for Unity3D last year. We were working on a project involving 2D sprites; at the time, the Unity Team had no 2D support so I developed this system to allow for 2D graphics. A month or so later, Unity3D released an official (and infinitely superior) set of tools for 2D sprites (doh!).

So yeah, you shouldn't really need to use this anymore.
